                    As studies continue to reveal yoga's many health benefits, this centuries-old Eastern philosophy is fast becoming the new
                    fitness soul mate for workout enthusiasts. Contemporary devotees range from high-powered execs trying to keep hearts beating
                    on a healthy note to image-conscious Hollywood stars striving for sleek physiques. Even prominent athletes are adding yoga to
                    their training regime to develop balanced, injury-free muscles and spines.

                <h2>Why You Should Never Stop Practicing Asana</h2>

                    The culture is getting into the deeper aspects of yoga, including meditation and mantra, but the asana, or physical postures, are as important as ever. In the classical eight limbs of yoga, asana, the third limb, allows us to let go of physical
                    tensions in the body, helping to bring us to a place where we feel empowered and connected to the world at large.
